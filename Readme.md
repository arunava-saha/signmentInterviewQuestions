## 1st Question:

By using the const keyword to declare variables that don't need reassignment, I've replaced the cout statements with the console.log function for output in the JavaScript environment. I've used the push method to add compressed parts to an array and join('') to concatenate them into a single string. This can be more memory-efficient than repeated string concatenation and this won't change the time complexity of the algorithm, but it can be more memory-efficient, especially for a longer input strings.

## 2nd Question:

By making two pointers slow and fast and keep slow at the head. Initially keep a gap of k between fast and slow pointer i.e. keep the fast pointer "k" steps away from the slow pointer. Then move both slow and fast pointers one step ahead each till fast reaches the end of the list. When fast reaches the last node then wherever slow is at, that will be our "kth" element from the end.

#### Recursion: solutions

The function makes two recursive calls. countRe(coins, n - 1, sum): This represents the case where the current coin is not considered in making change for the target sum. countRe(coins, n, sum - coins[n - 1]): This represents the case where the current coin is considered in making change for the target sum.

#### Memoization: solutions

Checks whether the result for the current state (represented by n and sum) has already been computed and stored in the memoization table (dp). If it has, the stored result is directly returned, avoiding redundant calculations.

The function makes two recursive calls. countMe(coins, sum - coins[n - 1], n, dp): Represents the case where the current coin is considered in making change for the target sum. countMe(coins, sum, n - 1, dp): Represents the case where the current coin is not considered in making change for the target sum. The final result is stored in the memoization table (dp[n][sum]) and returned.

#### dp solutions

The outer loop iterates over each coin in the provided array (coins). For each coin, the inner loop updates the dp array from the coin value (coins[i]) up to the target sum (sum). For each value j, dp[j] is updated by adding the number of ways to make change for j - coins[i]. This considers using the current coin in addition to the previously calculated ways. The final result is stored in dp[sum], which represents the total number of ways to make change for the target sum using the provided coins.
